# Neural Network Implementation

**(Disclaimer: As of currently, this README file is generated by a LLM)**

This repository contains a basic implementation of a neural network, including essential components such as activation functions, layers, and testing scripts. It is designed to provide a clear and modular approach to understanding and building neural networks from scratch.

## Overview

The project is organized into several Python scripts, each handling a specific aspect of the neural network. This modular design allows for easier understanding, maintenance, and extension of the codebase. Below is a detailed description of each file included in this repository.

## File Descriptions

1. activations.py
Description: This file contains various activation functions used in neural networks. Activation functions are crucial as they introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns.

2. xor_test.py
Description: This script is designed to test the neural network on the XOR problem. The XOR problem is a classic problem in machine learning and serves as a good benchmark for testing the learning capabilities of a neural network.

3. FCLayer.py
Description: This file defines the fully connected (dense) layer of the neural network. It handles the initialization of weights and biases, as well as the forward and backward propagation through the layer.

4. lost_functions.py
Description: This script includes various loss functions used to measure the performance of the neural network. Loss functions are used during training to update the network's weights and biases.

5. layer.py
Description: This file serves as an abstract base class for different types of layers in the neural network. It ensures a consistent interface for all layer types and facilitates the addition of new layer types in the future.

6. network.py
Description: This script brings together all components to define the overall neural network. It handles the creation of the network architecture, as well as the forward and backward propagation through the entire network.

7. mnist_test.py
Description: This script tests the neural network on the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training and testing image processing systems. This serves as a more complex test compared to the XOR problem, demonstrating the network's ability to handle real-world data.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a foundational framework for understanding and building neural networks from scratch. Each file is designed to be modular and easy to understand, facilitating learning and experimentation with different network architectures and training techniques.
